    name: "André Silva",
    bio: "I’m André Silva, a full-stack developer who started out fixing Linux, Windows, and Mac machines, only to realize I enjoyed building things inside the machines a lot more. Since 2018, I’ve gone from shipping Symfony websites during my internship (yes, https://pescamar.info is still alive 🐟) to tinkering with Next.js, React, Node.js, and Python projects that range from practical tools (PDF Manager, To-Do Apps) to the slightly over-engineered (a C firewall with a GTK UI, anyone?).",
    github: "https://github.com/andreatsilva",
    traits: [
      "Treats Git commits like diary entries (future me will thank me… hopefully).",
      "Can debug code and printers (though one of these is far more fun).",
      "Believes a clean UI is just as important as a clean terminal."
    ]
  },
  skills: [
    "Solid foundations in back end (Symfony, Node.js, SQL)",
    "Front end (React, Next.js, Tailwind)",
    "Real-world IT background, which means I understand systems from the metal up.",
    "A growing GitHub garden 🌱 of open-source projects you can actually click through."
  ],
  lookingFor: "Junior-level Full-Stack or Back End roles where I can keep solving interesting problems, push code that ships, and work with a team that values both best practices and good humor.",
  gaming: "And if you’re here just to peek at my projects: don’t worry, I do the same when I’m recruiting people for co-op gaming squads. 🎮"
